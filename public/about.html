<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a student and passionate web developer dedicated to building engaging, accessible, and performance-driven websites.
  From an early interest in how things work on the web, I've grown into a developer who enjoys crafting clean and responsive front-end experiences that not only look great but also function seamlessly across devices.
</p>
 <p>Recently, I began an internship in web development, where I’ve had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in a professional setting, work on real-world projects, and collaborate with experienced developers.
  This experience has deepened my understanding of industry workflows, version control, and modern development tools, and it has reinforced my commitment to writing clean, maintainable code.
</p>
<p>My core skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, and I’m constantly exploring new technologies and best practices to stay current in a fast-evolving field.
  I’m also a firm believer in user-centered design and take pride in developing intuitive, accessible interfaces.
  </p>
<p>Whether it’s a solo project or team collaboration, I bring curiosity, consistency, and a growth mindset to every task. My goal is to continue learning, take on new challenges, and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact.</p>
